Welcome to the **RAG-Based Question Answering System**! This project combines the power of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to build a high-performance Q/A system that provides accurate, contextually relevant answers to user queries. 

## 🛠 Project Overview

This project uses **RAG** to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models by pairing retrieval methods with generation techniques. By first retrieving relevant information, we allow the model to generate responses that are highly precise and deeply contextual. 🌟

## 💡 What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

An **LLM** is an AI model trained on extensive text data, giving it the ability to understand and generate human-like text. LLMs are versatile in handling tasks like text generation, translation, summarization, and Q/A.

### 🔥 Current Trends in LLMs

- **Enhanced Text Understanding**: Modern LLMs have advanced in text comprehension, allowing for more accurate responses across applications.
- **Pre-Trained Models**: Popular models like **GPT** and **Mistral** provide foundational capabilities for a variety of NLP tasks.
- **Customizable**: LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or domains to improve performance.

### 🏆 Examples of Popular LLMs

- **Mistral**: Known for efficient, large-scale language processing, useful in many NLP applications.
- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: Widely recognized and used for applications like chatbots, Q/A systems, and content creation.

## 🔍 What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines retrieval and generation to enhance accuracy. Here’s how RAG works:

1. **Retrieval Component**: Locates relevant information in a document corpus using semantic search or keyword matching.
2. **Generative Component**: Uses an LLM to generate a coherent response based on retrieved documents.
3. **Fusion Mechanism**: Merges retrieved information with generated content to ensure responses are accurate and contextually relevant.

---

## ⚙️ How Does RAG Integrate with LLMs?

Combining RAG with LLMs involves three main steps:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Fetch relevant documents or content for the user’s query.
2. **Response Generation**: Pass retrieved data to an LLM for response generation, utilizing both context and data to provide accurate answers.
3. **Response Fusion**: Enhance the response by fusing generated text with retrieved information, ensuring answers are well-rounded and insightful.

This integration enables our Q/A system to deliver highly accurate and contextually relevant responses. 🎯

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

### 1. Hugging Face API Key for Mistral 7B

To use the **Mistral 7B** model, you will need an API key from Hugging Face. You can obtain the key by signing up on the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/). After getting the API key, ensure it's set up in your environment for model access.

### 2. Weaviate Database API Key

This project utilizes a **Weaviate** database for semantic search. To access the Weaviate API, you will need an API key. Sign up at [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) and generate an API key to integrate with the project for document retrieval.

### 3. Python and Required Libraries

Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed on your machine. The necessary libraries will be installed from the `requirements.txt` file after setting up the environment.

```markdown
## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the RAG-based Q/A system. The project is structured modularly, with key components and files organized for clarity.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local system using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omshrivastav12/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Project Structure

Below is the project structure for your reference:

```plaintext
├── Dataset/                         # Contains sample dataset (replaceable with your own data)
│   └── quicksell_input.pdf          # Example input dataset
├── Vector_db_dir/                   # Directory containing the modular code
│   ├── Functions.py                 # Script for reusable functions
│   ├── main.py                      # Main script for execution
│   └── requirements.txt             # Dependencies specific to vector database
├── Merged_Papers_RAG.pdf            # Sample dataset (replaceable with your documents)
├── README.md                        # Project description and setup instructions
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment ensures that dependencies are isolated and manageable:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` files:

- Use the main `requirements.txt` file for the core dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- If using the modular functions in the `Vector_db_dir`, navigate to that directory and install its specific dependencies:

  ```bash
  cd Vector_db_dir
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  cd ..
  ```

### 5. Run the Code

The project uses modular Python scripts for execution. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `Vector_db_dir` directory.
2. Run the `main.py` file:

   ```bash
   python Vector_db_dir/main.py
   ```

   This will initialize the system and start processing based on the provided configurations.

### 6. Using Custom Files

- **Dataset**: Replace the `quicksell_input.pdf` file in the `Dataset` folder with your own dataset if needed.
- **Vector_db_dir**: Contains modular scripts:
  - `Functions.py`: Defines reusable functions for the RAG system.
  - `main.py`: Orchestrates the execution of the system.

Make modifications to these files as per your requirements to extend functionality or integrate custom features.

### 7. Output Results

The system generates responses by retrieving information from the documents and performing relevant processing. Review the output logs or generated files based on the input queries and model results.
